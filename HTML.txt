What is an HTML tag?

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) defines the structure and content of webpages. 

Almost all elements on an HTML page are just pieces of content wrapped in opening and closing HTML tags.
Opening tags tell the browser this is the start of an HTML element.
Closing tags tell the browser where an element ends. They are almost the same as opening tags; the only difference is that they have a forward slash before the keyword. For example, a closing paragraph tag looks like this: </p>.

 What is the purpose of the doctype declaration?
 The doctypeâ€™s purpose is to tell the browser what version of HTML it should use to render the document. The latest version of HTML is HTML5, and the doctype for that version is simply <!DOCTYPE html>.

<!DOCTYPE html>

<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>My First Webpage</title>
  </head>
</html>

What is the purpose of the head element?
The <head> element is where we put important meta-information about our webpages, and stuff required for our webpages to render correctly in the browser. Inside the <head>, we should not use any element that displays content on the webpage.


What is the purpose of the body element?
This is where all the content that will be displayed to users will go - the text, images, lists, links, and so on.

The Charset Meta Element
We should always have the meta tag for the charset encoding of the webpage in the head element: <meta charset="utf-8">.
Setting the encoding is very important because it ensures that the webpage will display special symbols and characters from different languages correctly in the browser.
