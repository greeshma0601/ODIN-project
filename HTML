What is an HTML tag?

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) defines the structure and content of webpages. 

Almost all elements on an HTML page are just pieces of content wrapped in opening and closing HTML tags.
Opening tags tell the browser this is the start of an HTML element.
Closing tags tell the browser where an element ends. They are almost the same as opening tags; the only difference is that they have a forward slash before the keyword. For example, a closing paragraph tag looks like this: </p>.
